#### Intro
I am a recent graudate from Harvard College and a current Associate Consultant at Bain & Company, where I am currently within their Private Equity Group. My projects involve diligencing target companies, often through primary interviews, market modeling, and financial analysis. I use this site as a personal way to host small and independent projects I work on.

Larger diligences have included big tech, packaging & logistics, chemicals, travel, and grocery retail (specific deal responsibilities available on request).
